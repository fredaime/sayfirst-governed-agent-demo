"""Refuse a change whose commits do not certify the Developer Certificate of Origin.

Article 15 asks that every contributor sign off each commit.

    python scripts/check_developer_certificate_of_origin.py --base=<ref> --head=<ref>

Every commit in `base..head` that is not a merge must carry a `Signed-off-by:` trailer
naming a person and an address. A merge commit introduces no work of its own and its parents
are checked where they were made, so it is passed over — which is what the certificate
itself asks for, and what refusing it would turn into a rule about merge strategy.

The exit code is the point: `0` when every commit certifies, `1` naming each one that does
not, `2` when the range could not be read at all — a shallow checkout has no range, and a
check that cannot see the commits must not report that they passed.
